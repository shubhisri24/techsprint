              <p>
                Our experience is built on modern WebXR and WebGL standards,
                implemented and led by Google through the Chrome platform. This
                enables camera-based, AR-like 3D experiences on mobile devices
                using only the browser.

              <h4>Interactive Mapping & Route Intelligence</h4>
              <p>
                The platform is built on Leaflet.js, a lightweight open-source
                mapping library, to visualize Delhi’s heritage monuments on an
                interactive map. Using Leaflet Routing Machine, users can
                generate routes between monuments, enabling walking or
                travel-based heritage trails.

              <h4>AI-Powered Voice Narration</h4>
              <p>
                We integrate Google’s Web Speech API to provide AI-driven
                text-to-speech narration. Monument stories are read aloud using
                natural-sounding voices, improving accessibility and engagement.
                This uses machine-learning speech synthesis built into Google
                Chrome — no external servers or exposed API keys.

              <h4>Google Chrome Platform Capabilities</h4>
              <p>
                The project relies on core Google Chrome technologies including
                secure camera access, on-device machine learning, WebGL
                rendering, and HTTPS security. These capabilities allow QR-to-3D
                workflows and smooth real-time interaction.

            Every year, physical heritage sites are lost to climate, urban
            sprawl, and time. Heirs of History creates a permanent, digital
            “living record.” By making heritage interactive and social-ready, we
            ensure the next generation values preservation as much as progress.
