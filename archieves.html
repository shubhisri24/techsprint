              <h3>The Tower That Marked a New Era</h3>
              <p>
                More than a victory tower, Qutub Minar represents the beginning
                of a new architectural language in India and records cultural
                transition rather than domination.

              <h3>A Monument That Outlived Its Empire</h3>
              <p>
                The Taj Mahal is not just a symbol of love but of precision and
                emotional storytelling through architecture.

            <div class="archive-content">
              <h3>When Knowledge Was the Greatest Power</h3>
              <p>
                Nalanda was a global center of learning where scholars from
                across Asia studied science and philosophy long before modern
                universities.

            <div class="archive-content">
              <h3>When Architecture Measured the Sky</h3>
              <p>
                Jantar Mantar proves that monuments were once scientific
                instruments. These massive stone structures tracked time and
                celestial movement with mathematical precision.

              <h3>Where History Became Everyday Life</h3>
              <p>
                Lodhi Garden blends medieval tombs with modern city life. What
                was once royal space is now a shared cultural ground where
                heritage exists quietly among people.

              <h3>A Monument Without Walls</h3>
              <p>
                The Lotus Temple represents a modern idea of heritage. Built as
                a space for silence and reflection, it welcomes people of all
                faiths without symbols, rituals, or hierarchy.
