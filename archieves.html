              <h3>The Tower That Marked a New Era</h3>
              <p>
                More than a victory tower, Qutub Minar represents the beginning
                of a new architectural language in India and records cultural
                transition rather than domination.

              <p>
                Nalanda was a global center of learning where scholars from
                across Asia studied science and philosophy long before modern
                universities.

                India Gate stands as a silent witness to sacrifice. Built to

              <h3>Power Etched in Red Stone</h3>
              <p>
                The Red Fort was not just a palace but the center of an empire.
                Its massive walls symbolized authority, governance, and the
                rhythm of Mughal rule.

              <p>
                The Lotus Temple represents a modern idea of heritage. Built as
